## Project Overview

**Campus Grab** is an innovative campus food ordering platform designed specifically for educational institutions. It is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that enables students to order food from on-campus canteens directly from their mobile devices, eliminating traditional queue-based ordering and significantly reducing wait times during peak hours.

## Concept Description

Campus Grab is a digital food ordering solution tailored for the unique environment of educational campuses. The platform addresses a fundamental problem faced by students daily: the inefficiency and time loss associated with waiting in long canteen queues during limited break periods. By digitizing the ordering process, Campus Grab transforms how students interact with campus food services.

The system operates on a dual-interface model. The **Student Interface** is a mobile-optimized web application that allows users to browse available menu items, view real-time availability, add items to a cart, place orders, and track order status from placement through preparation to pickup readiness. Each order receives a unique daily sequential token number (e.g., #0001, #0002) that resets at the start of each day, providing a simple and memorable reference for both students and canteen staff.

The **Admin Interface** provides canteen staff with a comprehensive dashboard to manage incoming orders, update order statuses in real-time, manage menu items (add, edit, remove, toggle availability), and access business analytics including total orders, revenue, average preparation times, and most popular items.

A distinguishing feature of Campus Grab is its **AI-powered recommendation engine** that learns from historical order data to suggest the fastest-preparing items and identify optimal ordering times based on peak hour analysis. This intelligent layer helps students make informed decisions when time is constrained.

The platform is built as a Progressive Web App, enabling students to install it directly on their smartphones without requiring app store distribution. This approach significantly reduces deployment friction and allows instant updates while providing a native app-like experience with features such as home screen installation, full-screen mode, and offline capabilities.

## Technical Innovation

Campus Grab leverages modern web technologies including Next.js 16.1.1, React 19.2.3, TypeScript 5.x, and Tailwind CSS 4.x for the frontend, with Supabase providing backend database and authentication services. The PWA architecture ensures cross-platform compatibility while maintaining the performance and user experience standards of native mobile applications.

## Commercial Application

The platform is designed for deployment across educational institutions including colleges, universities, and schools with on-campus food services. It can be adapted for single-canteen operations or scaled to support multiple food vendors within a campus ecosystem.
